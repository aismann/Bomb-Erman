Hello and welcome to our bomb'erman !

This Project was created with love by Ronan Boiteau, Oscar Stefanini, Erwan Simon, Fanny Tavart, Antoine Roche and Selim Rinaz aka Salty Queen's dev lab.

We use Irrlicht and IrrKlang libraries but no worries, we will install them for you, all you have to do is to perform a `./install.sh` and we will do all the stuff for you.

Enjoy our game !
